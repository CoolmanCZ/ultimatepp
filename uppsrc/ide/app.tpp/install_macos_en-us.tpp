[s1; U`+`+ macOS installation&]
[s3; After downloading the archive, unpack it to your home folder. 
Inside there is a theide application. (You will probably be denied 
running as it is from unrecognized source, you can override this 
by using local menu Open when running it for the first time).&]
[s3; U`+`+ requires C`+`+ toolchain to build applications. The installation 
in recent MacOS versions is trivial: open terminal and type `"clang`" 
`- macos will then install commandline tools required by U`+`+.&]
[s3; Additionally, U`+`+ needs openssl library (and some packages 
require ssh2 as well). Install with [^https`:`/`/brew`.sh`/^ homebrew]:&]
[s3; [C brew install openssl libssh2]&]
[s3; As long as you keep [*/ theide ](or [*/ umk]) just in the original 
directory, nothing will be written outside of it `- its `"sandboxed`". 
If you get bored with U`+`+ and need to clean the space, simply 
delete the `"upp`" folder.&]
[s3; If you move theide e.g. to [/ `~/bin], it will start to write 
things to[/  `~/.config ]and [/ `~/.cache].&]
